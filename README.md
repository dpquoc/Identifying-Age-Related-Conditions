# Identifying-Age-Related-Conditions

This project aims to predict if a person has one or more of three medical conditions based on health measurements, helping researchers link characteristics to conditions while maintaining privacy.

## Core Idea

The approach uses a **multi-model** and **multi-fold** strategy:

1. **Multi-Fold Cross-Validation:** In each k-fold split, multiple models are trained to capture diverse patterns in the data.
2. **Model Ensembling:** The models trained in each fold are ensembled to improve prediction accuracy.
3. **Final Prediction:** After training on all folds, predictions from all k-folds are ensembled to generate a reliable and robust final prediction.

This method improves the reliability of predictions and enhances model performance, ensuring better generalization and accuracy.
